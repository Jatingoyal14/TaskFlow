- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first layout works on all devices  
- **Frontend & Backend Simulation:** Client-side localStorage simulates backend data persistence

***

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React concepts simulated  
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js principles (simulated)  
- **Database:** Simulated MongoDB with browser localStorage  
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT) simulation with localStorage token management
